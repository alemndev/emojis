# 🍜 Emojis

Discover a new emoji that you may have never seen before or take a look at a whole range of emojis.

This project uses [EmojiHub](https://github.com/cheatsnake/emojihub), take a look 🐱. Thank you very much to [cheatsnake](https://github.com/cheatsnake).

## 🍚 How does it work?

Thanks to a simple search section, you can select if you want a random emoji or all of them.

That's not all, you can also make a more precise search by selecting the category or group you prefer.

Writing a category or group is a bit complicated, especially when you are not sure of its name, this is not a problem, browse through the options and select the one you like the most.

## 🍣 Dark mode

Switching from dark to light mode is just a click away. Choose the one you like best. Although I recommend you to take a look at the dark mode and see the light effects.
